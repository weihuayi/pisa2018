# 前言

The OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) assesses the
extent to which 15 year old students near the end of their compulsory education
have acquired the knowledge and skills that are essential for full
participation in modern societies. The assessment does not just ascertain
whether students can reproduce knowledge; it also examines how well students
can extrapolate from what they have learned and can apply that knowledge in
unfamiliar settings, both in and outside of school. This approach reflects the
fact that modern economies reward individuals not for what they know, but for
what they can do with what they know.

经合组织的国际学生评估计划, 主要评估15岁的学生在结束义务教育阶段时, 掌握参与现
代社会的必备知识和技能的程度. 评估不仅仅测试学生重现知识的能力, 同时测试学生举
一返三能力, 及应用所学知识到学校内外不熟悉环境的能力. 这种方法反映了这样一个事
实, 现代经济不会奖励个体知道什么, 而是奖励个体能用他们知道的做什么.


The triennial assessment, launched in 1997, focuses on the core school subjects
of reading, mathematics and science. Students’ proficiency in an innovative
domain is also assessed; in 2018, this domain was global competence. This
publication presents the theory underlying the PISA 2018 assessment – the
seventh since the programme’s inception. It includes frameworks for assessing
the three core subjects of reading, mathematics and science, the framework for
the third assessment of students’ financial literacy, and the framework for
assessing the innovative domain, global competence. These chapters outline the
content knowledge that students need to acquire in each domain, the processes
that students need to be able to perform, and the contexts in which this
knowledge and these skills are applied. The publication also discusses how each
domain is assessed. It concludes with the frameworks for the various
questionnaires distributed to students, school principals, parents and
teachers, and the framework for the new well-being questionnaire distributed to
students.

三年一次的测试, 启动于 1997 年, 专注于阅读, 数学和科学三门核心课程. 在 2018 年
又加入了一个新领域, 即全球胜任力. 这本出版物展示了 PISA 2018 测试的基础理论. 它
包括阅读, 数学和科学三门核心课程测试框架, 学生的财务素养的框架, 及最新的全球
胜任力的框架. 它给出了每个领域学生需要掌握的基础知识大纲, 学生需要掌握的程序性
技能, 及应用这些知识和技能的情境. 它也讨论了每个领域如何进行评估, 包括数个发给
学生, 学校校长, 家长和老师的调查问卷框架, 及发给学生的幸福调查问卷.


In PISA 2018, reading was the major domain of assessment, as it was in
2000 and 2009.  The three assessment subscales used in 2000 and 2009 were
renamed “locating information”, “understanding” and “evaluating and reflecting”
for 2018. Two new subscales were also used to describe students’ literacy with
single-source and multiple- source texts. The reading scale was also extended
by adding Level 1c, which better describes the proficiency of the
lowest-performing students.


在 PISA 2018 中, 阅读是主要的评估领域

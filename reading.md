# PISA 2018 阅读框架

Reading is the major domain of assessment of the 2018 cycle of the Programme for
International Student Assessment (PISA). This chapter defines reading literacy as it is
assessed in PISA 2018. It describes the types of processes and scenarios exhibited in the
tasks that PISA uses to assess reading literacy. Moreover, it describes how the nature of
reading literacy has changed over the past two decades, notably through the growing
presence of digital texts. The chapter also explains how PISA assesses the ease and
efficiency with which a student reads, and how it measures various metacognitive aspects
of students’ reading practices. It then discusses how student performance in reading is
measured and reported. Various sample items from the reading assessment are included at
the end of this chapter.

## 简介

### 做为主要领域的阅读

PISA 2018 marks the third time that reading is a major domain and the second
time that the reading literacy framework receives a major revision. Such a
revision must reflect the changing definition of reading literacy as well as
the changing contexts in which reading is used in citizens’ lives. Thus, the
present revision of the framework builds on contemporary and comprehensive
theories of reading literacy and considers how students acquire and use
information in a variety of contexts.


PISA 是第三次把阅读做为评估的主要领域, 也是第二次对阅读素养框架做比较大的修订.
这次修订必须反映阅读素养定义的变化, 也要反映阅读在公民生活中场景变化. 因此, 这
次框架的修订, 是建立在当代全面的阅读素养理论, 及学生在不同场景下如何获取和使用
信息的考虑之上的.


We live in a rapidly changing world in which both the quantity and variety of
written materials are increasing and where people are expected to use these
materials in new and increasingly complex ways. It is now generally accepted
that our understanding of reading literacy evolves as society and culture
themselves change. The reading literacy skills needed for individual growth,
educational success, economic participation and citizenship 20 years ago are
different from those required today, and it is likely that in 20 years’ time
they will change further still.


我们生活在一个急速变化的时代, 书面材料的数量和种类都极大的增加了, 同时人们被期
望采用新的且不断复杂化的方式使用这些材料. 我们对阅读素养的理解应随着社会和文化
的改变而不断演化, 这是一个普遍认同的共识. 二十年前, 个人成长, 学业成功, 经济参
与和公民关系所需要的阅读素养技能和今天需要的肯定不同, 很可能二十年后仍然会改变.


The goal of education has continued to shift its emphasis from the collection
and memorisation of information to a broader concept of knowledge: “whether a
technician or a professional person, success lies in being able to communicate,
share, and use information to solve complex problems, in being able to adapt
and innovate in response to new demands and changing circumstances, in being
able to marshal and expand the power of technology to create new knowledge and
expand human capacity and productivity” (Binkley et al., 2011 [1] ). The
ability to locate, access, understand and reflect on all kinds of information
is essential if individuals are to be able to participate fully in our
knowledge-based society.  Reading literacy is not only a foundation for
achievement in other subject areas within the educational system but also a
prerequisite for successful participation in most areas of adult life
(Cunningham and Stanovich, 1997 [2] ; OECD, 2013 [3] ; Smith et al., 2000 [4]
). The PISA framework for assessing the reading literacy of students towards
the end of compulsory education, therefore, must focus on reading literacy
skills that include finding, selecting, interpreting, integrating and
evaluating information from the full range of texts associated with situations
that extend beyond the classroom.

教育的目标持续地从强调信息的收集和记忆转移到更宽泛的知识概念: " 无论是技术人员
还是专业人士的成功, 都在于交流, 分享和利用信息解决复杂问题的能力, 在于自适应和
创造性的回应新需求和环境的改变, 在于调动和扩展技术的力量创造新的知识, 并扩展人
的能力和生产力(Binkley et al. 2011 [1]). 一个个体能够做到深入全面参与我们的知识
型社会, 定位, 获取, 理解和反思各种信息的能力至关重要. 阅读素养不仅是教育体系中
其它学科成功的基石, 也是成功参与成年大部分领域的前提(Cunningham and Stanovich,
1997 [2] ; OECD, 2013 [3] ; Smith et al., 2000 [4]). PISA 框架用于评估义务教育
阶段结束时学生的阅读素养. 因此, PISA 框架必须关注阅读素养中查找, 选
择, 解释, 整合和评估信息的技能, 这些文本信息来更宽泛的场景, 超出的课堂的范围.


## 阅读素养性质的改变

Evolving technologies have rapidly changed the ways in which people read and
exchange information, both at home and in the workplace. The automation of
routine jobs has created a demand for people who can adapt to quickly changing
contexts and who can find and learn from diverse sources of information. In
1997, when the first PISA framework for reading began to be discussed, just
1.7% of the world’s population used the Internet.  By 2014, the number had
grown to a global penetration rate of 40.4%, representing almost three billion
people (International Telecommunications Union, 2014 [5] ). Between 2007 and
2013, the number of mobile phone subscriptions doubled: in 2013, there were
almost as many active subscriptions as people on earth (95.5 subscriptions per
100 people) and the number of mobile broadband subscriptions had increased to
almost two billion worldwide (International Telecommunications Union, 2014 [6]
). The Internet increasingly pervades the life of all citizens, from learning
in and out of school, to working in real or virtual workplaces, to dealing with
personal matters such as taxes, health care or holiday planning.  Personal and
professional development is a lifelong endeavour and the students of tomorrow
will need to be skilled with digital tools in order to successfully manage the
increased complexity and quantity of information available.

无论在家里还是工作场所, 不断演化的技术已经急速地改变人们阅读和交换信息的方式.
例行工作的自动化, 已经为人们创造了一个新的需求, 即能够适应快速变化的环境, 且能
从多种信息源进行查找和学习. 在 1997 年, 即开始讨论第一个 PISA 的阅读框架时, 全
世界只有 1.7% 的人口使用互联网. 到 2014 年为止, 使用互联网的人口已经达到 40.4%,
接近 30 亿人口 (International Telecommunications Union, 2014 [5] ). 2007 年到
2013 年间, 移动电话用户数量翻番. 在 2013 年移动电话保有量几乎和地球人数一样多(每
100 人 95.5 部), 而移动宽带用户数量增加近 20 亿 (国际电信联盟, 2014年[6]). 因特
网渗入所有公民的生活, 从学校内外的学习, 到真实或虚拟的工作场所的工作, 到处理个
人事务如税收, 健康护理或者假期计划. 个人和专业发展是终身的努力, 明天的学生需要
熟练掌握数字工具, 才能成功管理现有信息日益增长的复杂性和数量. 

In the past, the primary interest when evaluating student reading literacy
proficiency was the ability to understand, interpret and reflect upon single
texts. While these skills remain important, greater emphasis on the integration
of information technologies into citizens’ social and work lives requires that
the definition of reading literacy be updated and extended. It must reflect the
broad range of newer skills associated with literacy tasks required in the 21
st century (Ananiadou and Claro, 2009 [7] ; Kirsch et al., 2002 [8] ; Rouet,
2006 [9] ; Spiro et al., 2015 [10] ). This necessitates an expanded definition
of reading literacy encompassing both basic reading processes and higher-level
digital reading skills while recognising that what constitutes literacy will
continue to change due to the influence of new technologies and changing social
contexts (Leu et al., 2013 [11] ; 2015 [12] ).

在过去, 评估学生阅读熟练程度时, 更关注学生理解, 解释和思考单一文本的能力. 当然,
现在这些方面的技能仍然重要

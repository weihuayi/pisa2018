# PISA 2018 阅读框架

Reading is the major domain of assessment of the 2018 cycle of the Programme for
International Student Assessment (PISA). This chapter defines reading literacy as it is
assessed in PISA 2018. It describes the types of processes and scenarios exhibited in the
tasks that PISA uses to assess reading literacy. Moreover, it describes how the nature of
reading literacy has changed over the past two decades, notably through the growing
presence of digital texts. The chapter also explains how PISA assesses the ease and
efficiency with which a student reads, and how it measures various metacognitive aspects
of students’ reading practices. It then discusses how student performance in reading is
measured and reported. Various sample items from the reading assessment are included at
the end of this chapter.

## 简介

### 做为主要领域的阅读

PISA 2018 marks the third time that reading is a major domain and the second
time that the reading literacy framework receives a major revision. Such a
revision must reflect the changing definition of reading literacy as well as
the changing contexts in which reading is used in citizens’ lives. Thus, the
present revision of the framework builds on contemporary and comprehensive
theories of reading literacy and considers how students acquire and use
information in a variety of contexts.


PISA 是第三次把阅读做为评估的主要领域, 也是第二次对阅读素养框架做比较大的修订.
这次修订必须反映阅读素养定义的变化, 也要反映阅读在公民生活中场景变化. 因此, 这
次框架的修订, 是建立在当代全面的阅读素养理论, 及学生在不同场景下如何获取和使用
信息的考虑之上的.


We live in a rapidly changing world in which both the quantity and variety of
written materials are increasing and where people are expected to use these
materials in new and increasingly complex ways. It is now generally accepted
that our understanding of reading literacy evolves as society and culture
themselves change. The reading literacy skills needed for individual growth,
educational success, economic participation and citizenship 20 years ago are
different from those required today, and it is likely that in 20 years’ time
they will change further still.


我们生活在一个急速变化的时代, 书面材料的数量和种类都极大的增加了, 同时人们被期
望采用新的且不断复杂化的方式使用这些材料. 我们对阅读素养的理解应随着社会和文化
的改变而不断演化, 这是一个普遍认同的共识. 二十年前, 个人成长, 学业成功, 经济参
与和公民关系所需要的阅读素养技能和今天需要的肯定不同, 很可能二十年后仍然会改变.


The goal of education has continued to shift its emphasis from the collection
and memorisation of information to a broader concept of knowledge: “whether a
technician or a professional person, success lies in being able to communicate,
share, and use information to solve complex problems, in being able to adapt
and innovate in response to new demands and changing circumstances, in being
able to marshal and expand the power of technology to create new knowledge and
expand human capacity and productivity” (Binkley et al., 2011 [1] ). The
ability to locate, access, understand and reflect on all kinds of information
is essential if individuals are to be able to participate fully in our
knowledge-based society.  Reading literacy is not only a foundation for
achievement in other subject areas within the educational system but also a
prerequisite for successful participation in most areas of adult life
(Cunningham and Stanovich, 1997 [2] ; OECD, 2013 [3] ; Smith et al., 2000 [4]
). The PISA framework for assessing the reading literacy of students towards
the end of compulsory education, therefore, must focus on reading literacy
skills that include finding, selecting, interpreting, integrating and
evaluating information from the full range of texts associated with situations
that extend beyond the classroom.

教育的目标持续地从强调信息的收集和记忆转移到更宽泛的知识概念: " 无论是技术人员
还是专业人士的成功, 都在于交流, 分享和利用信息解决复杂问题的能力, 在于自适应和
创造性的回应新需求和环境的改变, 在于调动和扩展技术的力量创造新的知识, 并扩展人
的能力和生产力(Binkley et al. 2011 [1]). 一个个体能够做到深入全面参与我们的知识
型社会, 定位, 获取, 理解和反思各种信息的能力至关重要. 阅读素养不仅是教育体系中
其它学科成功的基石, 也是成功参与成年大部分领域的前提(Cunningham and Stanovich,
1997 [2] ; OECD, 2013 [3] ; Smith et al., 2000 [4]). PISA 框架用于评估义务教育
阶段结束学生的阅读素养. 因此, PISA 框架必须超出课堂范围的, 关注阅读素养中查找, 选择, 解释, 整合
和评估信息的技能,
